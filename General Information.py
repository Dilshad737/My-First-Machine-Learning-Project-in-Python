This tutorial assumes Python version 2.7 or 3.5.
There are 5 key libraries that you will need to install. Below is a list of the Python SciPy libraries required for this tutorial:

    scipy
    numpy
    matplotlib
    pandas
    sklearn

There are many ways to install these libraries. My best advice is to pick one method then be consistent in installing each library.
