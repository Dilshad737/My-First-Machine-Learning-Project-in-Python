We are going to use the iris flowers dataset. This dataset is famous because it is used as the “hello world” dataset in machine learning and statistics by pretty much everyone. The dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers. There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimeters. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. All observed flowers belong to one of three species.

This is a good project because it is so well understood.

    Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.
    It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.
    It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.
    It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).
    All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.
